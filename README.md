# Mossweather
Code and STL files for a weather station tracking weather data at moss sites using an arduino mega 2560.


This is a personal project aimed at creating a weather station used to record weather data at sites where bryophytes naturally grow. 
In its final form it should be able to track temperature of soil, at ground level, in the air, humidity of soil, at ground level and in the air, pressure, upwards and downwards radiation, precipitation and wind velocity. To correlate weather data with growth a camera is used to make pictures of the site. Besides high percise measurements long endurance is a key feature.

Hardware used is an Arduino Mega 2560 and compatible breakout boards.
